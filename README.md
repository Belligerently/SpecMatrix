## Installation
To install and run the app, follow these steps based on your role:

### For Developers:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/belligerently/SpecMatrix
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode and connect your iOS device or simulator.
3. Build and run the project directly through Xcode.

### For Normal Users:
1. Download the IPA file from the [release section](https://github.com/Belligerently/SpecMatrix/releases) of this repository.
2. Install the IPA file using a sideloading app such as [SideStore](https://sidestore.io) or [AltStore](https://altstore.io), which allow sideloading of up to 3 apps.

   Alternatively, you can use a certificate (.p12 and .mobileprovision) from an Apple Developer account, [KravaSign](https://kravasign.com), or another certificate-providing service. Certificates are required for sideloading because Apple restricts the installation of apps outside the App Store for security reasons. These certificates verify the app's authenticity and allow it to be installed on your device. After obtaining the certificate, you can use an app like [Feather Sign](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather) to sign and install the app.

3. Follow the instructions provided by the sideloading app or signing tool to complete the installation.
